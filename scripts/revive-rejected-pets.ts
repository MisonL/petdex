// One-shot rescue: every rejected pet was bounced for "duplicated" or
// pointed to a near-twin slug. Duplication isn't actually a rejection
// reason — the gallery is fine with similar pets — so we revive them
// all to approved, refresh embeddings, and email the owners with an
// apology + the same launch checklist as a fresh approval.
//
// Dry run by default (prints what it would do), like the other maintenance
// scripts: this flips every rejected row to approved and emails real people,
// so the destructive pass has to be asked for explicitly with --apply.
