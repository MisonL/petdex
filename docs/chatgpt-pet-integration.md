# ChatGPT pet integration (`codex://pets/install`)

Everything here was read out of ChatGPT.app's own bundle on 2026-08-27, against
version **26.818.61809**. None of it is a documented contract. When OpenAI ships
an update, re-derive it with the recipe at the bottom rather than trusting this
file: the point of writing it down is that the next pass starts from a known
shape, not from zero.

## Status: parser present; modal remains feature-gated

The current bundle still contains the parser, downloader, and renderer listener
for the Petdex link, and the listener remains behind Statsig gate
`1848317837`. This pass re-checked those bundle markers on version
26.818.61809. A bundle scan cannot prove the live value of the gate; the
previous no-modal observation was tied to an older app version and must not be
generalized to every installation.

If the modal is absent, first verify the gate and then inspect the filesystem.
Keep the `petdex://` path beside it as the documented fallback; it does not
depend on this ChatGPT feature gate.

## The contract

```
codex://pets/install?name=…&description=…&imageUrl=…&spriteVersionNumber=…
```

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Schemes | `codex://` and `codex-dev://` |
| Host | must be `pets` |
| Path | exactly one segment, `install` |
| Params | `name`, `description`, `imageUrl`, `spriteVersionNumber` |
| Extra params | **one unknown param rejects the whole URL** |
| `name` | required, trimmed, non-empty |
| `description` | optional |
| `imageUrl` | required, must parse as a URL with protocol `https:` |
| `spriteVersionNumber` | must coerce to `1` or `2`; defaults to `1` |

`spriteVersionNumber` is the one that bit us: Petdex ships v2 atlases, and
omitting it defaults the app to layout 1, which misreads every frame. It was
absent from the original builder because that was inferred from a JSON-LD
`InstallAction` on `chatgpt.com/s/sharepet_<id>`, which does not carry it.

### What the downloader demands

Separate from the URL parse, the asset fetch enforces:

- `redirect: "manual"`, and it **throws on any redirect status**. The URL has to
  answer 200 directly. A CDN that 301s to its origin breaks the install.
- `Content-Type` must be `image/png` or `image/webp` (the type is lowercased and
  split on `;`, so a charset suffix is fine).
- 20 MB ceiling, checked against `Content-Length` and again while streaming.

The live v2 manifest was reachable during this pass and returned 4,667 entries.
A sampled `assets.petdex.dev` sheet answered directly with HTTP 200 and
`image/webp`; this is a reachability probe, not a claim about the largest asset.

## Why a correct link still does nothing

The main process parses the URL, matches `case 'petInstall'`, focuses the
window, and posts `open-pet-install-modal` to the renderer. The renderer's
listener is:

```js
let t = kh(`1848317837`);
Kf(`open-pet-install-modal`, n => {
  t && Promise.all([...]).then(...)
})
```

`kh()` is the Statsig gate helper. With the gate off, `t` is falsy, the `&&`
short-circuits, and the message is dropped with no error and no log. From the
outside this is indistinguishable from the URL never arriving, which is why the
first diagnosis has to be "check the gate", not "fix the link".

`1848317837` appears exactly once in the bundle.

## Where the code lives

Paths inside `Contents/Resources/app.asar` (they carry content hashes and
**will change** on any update — grep for the symbols, not the filenames):

| What | Where | Grep for |
|---|---|---|
| URL parser | `.vite/build/window-all-closed-*.js` | `` kind:`petInstall` `` |
| Host switch | same file | `` case`pets` `` |
| Allowed params | same file | `` new Set([`name`,`description` `` |
| Deep link handler | `.vite/build/main-*.js` | `` case`petInstall` `` |
| IPC handlers | same file | `"pet-install"`, `"pet-install-preview"` |
| Install manager | same file | `petInstallManager`, class with `preview`/`install` |
| Asset validation | same file | `Pet spritesheet redirects are not allowed` |
| Renderer listener + gate | `webview/assets/app-initial-*.js` | `open-pet-install-modal` |

There is also a `pet-install-preview` IPC handler taking the same four
arguments, which returns a data URL instead of installing. Nothing reachable
from a deep link uses it — it is what the modal renders.

## How to re-derive this after an update

```bash
# 1. Extract to a temporary directory. The bundle and extracted size vary by
#    app release; allow several hundred MB and delete the temporary directory
#    after inspection.
npx --yes @electron/asar extract \
  /Applications/ChatGPT.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar /tmp/asar

# 2. Is the route still there?
grep -rl "petInstall" --include="*.js" /tmp/asar

# 3. Read the parser -- this is the authority on the URL shape
python3 - <<'EOF'
import glob
p = glob.glob('/tmp/asar/.vite/build/window-all-closed-*.js')[0]
s = open(p, encoding='utf8', errors='replace').read()
i = s.index('kind:`petInstall`')
print(s[i-1600:i+400])
EOF

# 4. Did the gate id change, or the gate disappear (feature shipped)?
grep -rho "1848317837" --include="*.js" /tmp/asar | wc -l

rm -rf /tmp/asar
```

The bundle is minified but not obfuscated: identifiers are mangled, string
literals are not. Every anchor in the table above is a string literal, which is
why they survive rebuilds.

### Testing a link end to end

```bash
open "codex://pets/install?name=Boba&description=x&imageUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.petdex.dev%2F…%2Fsprite.webp&spriteVersionNumber=2"
```

**Pick a pet that is not already installed.** An installed slug can succeed for
the wrong reason. The only honest check is the filesystem, not the screen:

```bash
ls ~/.codex/pets/<slug>/
find ~/Library -iname "*.webp" -newermt "-5 minutes" 2>/dev/null | grep -i openai
```

## The reverse direction already works

Petdex reads ChatGPT's pets with no conversion: same atlas, same 9 state rows,
same frame counts, measured cell by cell. `~/.codex/pets/` is a root the desktop
app scans directly, and the CLI writes both roots on install. So a pet acquired
either way shows up in both places, and `petdex://<slug>` is the path that
actually works today.
