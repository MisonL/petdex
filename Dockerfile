# Production image for the Petdex web app.
#
# Four stages: `deps` installs from the lockfile, `source` is that tree plus
# the code (what the compose `migrate` service needs), `builder` compiles the
# Next app on top of it, and `runner` carries only what the server reads at
# runtime. The runtime needs a fraction of the install, so copying the whole
# tree into the final image (~928M of `node_modules` here) is the thing to
# avoid.
#
# Bun is the base throughout: the app's server code is plain Node API, but
# `scripts/seed-dev.ts` needs `bun --conditions react-server` to resolve the
# React server entry points, so the image has to carry bun anyway.

# — once per distinct set of build args — and run `next build` a second time

# `next build` imports every route module to collect page data, and two throw
# at module scope when the env is missing: `src/lib/db/client.ts:39` on
# DATABASE_URL, and the rate-limit secret IIFE at
# `src/app/api/telemetry/event/route.ts:109` in production. Both are builder
# stage only — the runner gets the real values from the compose
# `environment:` block, so no placeholder reaches the shipped image.

# `/[locale]/pets/[slug]` is `force-static` and its `generateStaticParams`
# queries the DB, so page-data collection is a real query — the build fails on
# `connect ECONNREFUSED`, not on a missing variable. A placeholder URL is not
# enough, and pointing at the compose Postgres would mean a build that only
# works after `docker compose up` has run. So the builder stage brings its own:
# a throwaway cluster, pushed to the schema, discarded with the stage. Fresh
# clone plus Docker is the whole requirement.
#
# Split in two because a process cannot outlive its RUN: the install and
# `initdb` depend only on the base image and cache on their own, while the
# start/push/build/stop cycle has to sit in one RUN with `bun run build`.
#
# `initdb -U petdex --auth=trust` makes that role the superuser and skips
# password files, which is why the URL above carries no credentials and can
# listen on plain loopback — nothing outside the build container can reach it.

# `scripts/write-build-version.ts` shells out to `git rev-parse` and falls
# back to a timestamp when git is missing, which is the case here — `.git` is
# excluded by `.dockerignore`, so the version reads `local-…`. Copying `.git`
# in would add the whole history to the context for one short hash.
#
# The throwaway Postgres from the layer above has to be started in the same RUN
# as the build: each RUN is its own container, so a server left running by an
# earlier one is not there. `-w` blocks until it accepts connections, so
# `createdb` and `drizzle-kit push` cannot race it.
#
# The seed matters as much as the schema. The home page and the locale roots
# are `force-static`, so this build prerenders them — against an empty database
# they bake in "0+ open-source pets" and an empty gallery, and the container
# serves that until the 24h `revalidate` expires. Seeding here with the same
# script the compose `migrate` service runs means the prerendered HTML
# describes the same rows the running app will read.
#
# The seeded rows are not `featured`, so `getStaticPetSlugs` returns nothing
# and no `/[locale]/pets/[slug]` page is prerendered — those render on demand
# (`dynamicParams` is true). The seed is what makes the gallery non-empty, not
# what makes pet pages static.
#
# (`--conditions react-server` is what `bun run seed:dev` uses; the script
# resolves the React server entry points.)
