//
// Strategy: check the Origin header (modern browsers always set it on
// cross-origin POST/PUT/DELETE). If Origin is present and not on our
// allowlist, reject. If Origin is missing (some same-origin clients
// like server-to-server fetch don't send it), we fall back to checking
// Sec-Fetch-Site, which is set by all modern browsers.
//
// Allow same-origin, the canonical site URL, the Vercel URL of the running
// deployment (preview or production), and localhost for local dev.

// Compared as full origins, not hosts, so the scheme is part of the entry.
// A host-only check admitted `http://petdex.dev` on the https site: the app
// never serves that origin (Cloudflare 308s it to https and HSTS pins it),
// so nothing legitimate carries it, and a request that does is claiming a
// site this deployment is not. The loopback names keep both schemes because
// local dev serves plain http and a dev over https is still the same server.

 * same-origin `fetch()` POST sends `Origin: <that origin>`, and every
 * guarded endpoint 403s. The compose deployment hit this on
 * `http://127.0.0.1:3100`. `PETDEX_URL` is already read as the configured
 * public origin by `src/proxy.ts` and `/api/pets/random`.
 *
 * The loopback names are included at the configured port because they are the
 * same server: a developer reaches the container by whichever the browser
 * autocompletes, and `public-origin.ts` already treats `127.0.0.1`,
 * `localhost`, and `[::1]` as equivalent. Restricting the aliases to the
 * configured port keeps this from admitting an unrelated local service.
