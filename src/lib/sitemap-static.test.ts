// `/sitemap.xml` is a prerendered route (`○` with `revalidate = 86400`). The
// build only keeps it static while everything it reaches is static too, and
// the sitemap filters its facet entries on the approved-pet counts.
//
// Reaching those counts through `loadFacets` — which reads Upstash before
// falling back to the `unstable_cache`d computation — made Next render the
// whole route dynamically. The build then reported `/sitemap.xml` as `ƒ`, and
// every request recomputed `lastModified: new Date()`, so `<lastmod>` in the
// XML changed on each fetch. That is the opposite of what the element means:
// it is supposed to be the page's last content change, and a value that moves
// on every request is one crawlers learn to ignore.
//
// `loadFacetsForSitemap` is the same computation without the Redis hop. This
// asserts the sitemap uses it, because the regression is invisible in every
// unit test — it only shows up in the build's route table.
