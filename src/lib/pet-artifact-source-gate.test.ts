// `publishPetPublicArtifacts` gates on the pet's stored spritesheet URL, and a
// URL stored under a legacy public host is deliberately absent from the asset
// allowlist — so checking it as stored refused the pet and it never got a
// thumbnail, preview, or sticker, even though the object was still readable.
// The fix is the one `install-script.ts` carries: rewrite before validating,
// so the value that is checked is the value that is served.
//
// This drives the real function. The R2 stub answers the source GET and each
// HEAD; when the stored `petdex-source-sha256` matches the source, all three
// artifacts are skipped and the function returns before any sharp work — the
// assertion is about which URL passes the gate, not how images are built.
//
// `r2.send` is replaced in place (an own property shadowing the prototype
// method) and restored afterward, NOT `mock.module`-ed. `mock.module` is
// process-wide and `mock.restore()` did not reliably undo it for a later file
// on Bun 1.4.2: this suite loaded before `r2.test.ts`, the stub's `r2` (a bare
// `{ send }`) reached it, and `getSignedUrl` died on
// `client.config.endpointProvider` — three failures in a file that never
// touched this stub. Patching the singleton leaves the real client, its
// `config`, and every other export intact, which is the same reason
// `asset-size-guard.test.ts` takes this route.
